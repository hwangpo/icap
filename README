ICAP Readme
==============================================================================

The ICAP project is divided up into a number of libraries, as follows:

    geometry    -- represents a parsed pipe network and includes a number of
                   interfaces for accessing elements of the geometry without
                   requiring access to the entire object.
    hpg_create  -- provides code for computing HPGs.
    hpg_interp  -- provides code for interpolating HPGs.
    icap        -- this contains the main model execution code.  Depending on
                   the project configuration, this will compile to a DLL or
                   to a console-based EXE.
    model       -- provides an interface that represents a computation model
                   and associated elements.  In addition, contains data type
                   metadata.
    time        -- a library for working with dates and times.
    util        -- utility functions.
    xslib       -- contains abstract cross-section object and some common
                   implementations for common pipe cross-sectional geometry.

In addition, a unit test project is included which has some basic unit tests
for verifying computational integrity.

The wiki directory contains binary releases as well as examples and tutorial
data and images for the wiki.
